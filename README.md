# Smart Calculator üî¢

This is a simple yet powerful **Smart calculator** I built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports both basic arithmetic and a few scientific functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `tan`. I also added a small history panel to keep track of the last few calculations.

## ‚ú® Features

* Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `√ó`, `√∑`, `%`
* Scientific functions: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()` (input in degrees)
* Responsive layout with a modern design
* Keyboard support for quick input
* Shows last 3 calculations in the history panel
* Smooth UI interactions with hover effects

## üöÄ How to Use

Just open the `index.html` file in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
No setup or external libraries needed ‚Äî it's all in one file!

## üß† Some Notes

* Trig functions use **degree** input (not radians).
* The calculator only shows the last 3 calculations in the history panel.
* `DEL` will remove the last digit, and `AC` clears everything.
* The layout uses a 5-column grid to fit scientific buttons alongside standard ones.
